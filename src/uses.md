# What do I use?

## Software

I've been doing a lot of code editing in VSCode, but occasionally switch back to PHPStorm when I want better PHP debugging, or even Sublime Text if I want to quickly edit some text files. My primary terminal app is iTerm, but I'm also dabbling with Hyper, lately.

## Learning Resources

I'm a lifetime member to [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/), an excellent resource for learning Laravel, PHP, VueJS, and a lot more.
